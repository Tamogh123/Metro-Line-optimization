# Metro-Line-optimization
This project has been made for classifying whether a station can be claassified as a metro station or not and connect all possible prospective stations to make the best coverage metro network with non-intercepting neighbours.
# Dataset used
We have created our own dataset using several goverment websites and other sites.The different parameters considered are:<br>
1.popden<br>	2.hospitals<br>	3.entertainment<br>	4.monuments<br>	5.schools<br>	6.rent<br>	7.lat<br>	8.long<br>	9.railway<br>	10.traffic<br> 	11.city<br>
# Models used
we have utilized Random forest and XGboost to train the dataset.
# Results
Accuracy in Random forest-81%<br>
Accuracy in XGboost-86%<br>
F1 score in Random forest-87%<br>
F1 score in XGboost-91%<br>
